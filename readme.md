# Sozoku

RAT (Remote Access Trojan) written in Golang.

## Usage

Navigate to the server main file and change your ip address and port. When everything is set just run `make build_server` (only build) or `make run_server` (build and run). 

As for the client, you will also need to navigate to it's main file and change the ip address and port. After that just run `make build_client` and send the executable to the victim.

NOTE: This is a simple RAT with no obfuscation whatsoever.
